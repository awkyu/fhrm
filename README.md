BME 398: Fetal Heart Rate Monitor Circuit Design

This project was a small design project that was never fully realized as a proposal for an at-home Fetal Heart Rate Monitor. Signal artefacts are a major issue in current fetal heart rate sensors, leading to misdiagnoses that can lead to fetal mortality. Both Fetal Heart Rate and Fetal Movement are essential indicators for fetal health, providing information on cardiovascular and nervous system development, respectively. The device proposed here aims to limit these artefacts.
